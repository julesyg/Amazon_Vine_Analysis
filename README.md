## SUMMARY: 

In summary, there does not seem to be positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program as only 52.38% of the reviews were 5 stars. Of the unpaid reviews, 57.80% were 5 stars which makes it difficult to make a solid case for whether there is a difference between Vine and unpaid reviews. Additional analysis could be beneficial, perhaps on a smaller sample dataset.
